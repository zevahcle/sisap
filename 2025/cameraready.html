            <h1>Instructions for the Camera-Ready Version</h1>
            <p>Please take the comments made by the reviewers carefully into account when preparing your camera-ready
                paper for the proceedings.
                The final paper and the signed copyright form are due on <b>July 31st, 2025</b>. This is a firm
                deadline for the production of the proceedings.</p>

                
            <h2>Final paper</h2>
            <p>Please submit the files belonging to your camera-ready paper through EasyChair, by logging in with the proceedings author role.</p>
            <p>Please upload the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>either a zipped file containing all your LaTeX sources (including style files, bib files and images), or a Word file in the RTF format,</li>
                <li>a PDF version of your camera-ready paper for reference, and</li>
                <li>the signed copyright form.  You can download a pre-compiled version of the Springer licence-to-publish form <a
                    href="licence-to-publish.docx">here</a>. It is sufficient for one of the authors to sign the copyright form. 
                    You can scan the form into PDF or any other standard image format before uploading it on EasyChair.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The maximum page limit is 14 pages for long research papers and 8 pages for short papers (which include short research papers, demo papers, doctoral symposium papers, and indexing challenge papers).</p>
            <p>Please, follow strictly the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">author instructions of Springer</a> and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, when preparing the final version. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are available in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WsdHOy5uZpg">Overleaf</a>.</p>
            <p>Springer encourages authors to include their <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid">ORCIDs</a> in their papers.</p>

            <p>Before submitting the camera-ready version, please check the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Capitalize paper headings (e.g., "Similarity Searching Without Troubles" instead of "Similarity searching without troubles")</li>
                <li>Mark the corresponding author</li>
                <li>Check that your PDF file only contains allowed fonts</li>
                <li>For LaTeX authors, make sure that your project can be compiled</li>
                <li>If you want to include an Appendix, make sure the final paper, including the Appendix, stays within the page limits. In this case, place the Appendix in front of the references. Differently, in case your Appendix makes your paper overflow the given page limits, remove it from your final paper and make it available online (Arxiv, personal webpage, etc.), appropriately referencing it from within the paper.</li>
                <li>If you wish to add an Acknowledgements section, this should always be a run-in heading and not a section or sub-section heading. It should not be assigned a number.</li>
                <li><strong>Include a  “Disclosure of Interests” section.</strong> Springer requires authors to declare any competing interests or to specifically state that the authors have no competing interests. Please place the statement with a third-level heading in 9-point font size beneath the (optional) acknowledgments as indicated in LNCS template.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Authors should make sure that they have included all necessary acknowledgments and disclosure of interests before sending the files. Updates at a later stage are not possible. If the authors have problems fitting acknowledgments and disclosure of interests within the page limits, we can accept having these items overflow to the next page (13th page for long papers and 9th page for short papers).</p>


            <p>Our publisher has recently introduced an extra control loop: once data processing is finished, they will contact all corresponding authors and ask them to check their papers. 
                We expect this to happen shortly before the printing of the proceedings. At that time, your quick interaction with Springer-Verlag will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Authors should read Springer's <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> information.</p>

            

            <h2>Mandatory Registration</h2>
            <p>Please note that at least one (unique) <a href="registration.html">registration</a> is required for each
                accepted paper to be included in the final proceedings.
                When registering, don't forget to indicate the paper ID.
        
            </p>
            <h2>Copyright</h2>
            <p>The corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must
                complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form.
                A pre-filled Springer copyright form can be <a
                    href="licence-to-publish.docx">found here</a>.
                The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the
                paper.
                Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be
                made.</p>
            <p>Please upload a signed and completed copyright form in EasyChair, after logging in with the proceedings author role.
                You can scan the form into PDF.
                Springer does not accept digital signatures on the copyright right forms at present.</p>
            <p>Authors employed by US Government contractors or US Government departments may have to sign an
                alternative form.
                It is imperative that such authors contact their legal departments and also get in touch with us as soon
                as their paper has been accepted.</p>
            <p>It is essential that the copyright form is correct, so please check before sending the file.
                The corresponding author must sign the form on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper,
                having gained their permission to do so.
                They sign for and accept responsibility for releasing the material on behalf of any and all
                co-authors.</p>
