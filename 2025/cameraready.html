            <h1>Instructions for the Camera-Ready Version</h1>
            <p>Please take the comments made by the reviewers carefully into account when preparing your camera-ready
                paper for the proceedings.
                The final paper and the signed copyright form are due on <b>July 31st, 2025</b>. This is a firm
                deadline for the production of the proceedings.</p>

                <b>Detailed instruction will be published shortly in this page.

            <!-- <h2>Final paper</h2>
            <p>Please submit the files belonging to your camera-ready paper through EasyChair.</p>
            <p>Please upload the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>either a zipped file containing all your LaTeX sources (including style files, bib files and
                    images), or a Word file in the RTF format, and</li>
                <li>a PDF version of your camera-ready paper for reference,</li>
                <li>the signed copyright form.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The maximum page limit is 14 pages for long papers and 8 pages for short/demo papers.</p>
            <p>Before submitting the camera-ready version, please:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>capitalize paper headings (e.g., "Similarity Searching Without Troubles" instead of "Similarity
                    searching without troubles")</li>
                <li>mark the corresponding author</li>
                <li>check that your PDF file only contains allowed fonts</li>
                <li>for LaTeX authors, make sure that your project can be compiled</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Authors may choose to add an Acknowledgments section if they wish. This should always be a run-in 
                heading and not a section or sub-section heading. It should not be assigned a number. The acknowledgments 
                may include references to grants or support received in relation to the work presented in the paper. 
                Authors should make sure that they have included all necessary acknowledgments before sending the files. 
                Updates at a later stage are not possible.</p>

            <p>Appendices will be left out of the proceedings, so please remove any appendix from your final paper but
                make sure that it will be available online (Arxiv, personal webpage, etc.).</p>

            <p>Please, follow strictly the <a
                    href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">author
                    instructions of Springer</a>
                and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, when preparing the final version.
                Springerâ€™s proceedings LaTeX templates are available in <a
                    href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WsdHOy5uZpg">Overleaf</a>.
                Springer encourages authors to include their <a
                    href="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid">ORCIDs</a> in their papers.</p>
            <p>Our publisher has recently introduced an extra control loop: once data processing is finished,
                they will contact all corresponding authors and ask them to check their papers. We expect this to
                happen shortly before the printing of the proceedings. At that time your quick interaction with
                Springer-Verlag will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Authors should read Springer's <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> information.</p>                

            <h2>Mandatory Registration</h2>
            <p>Please note that at least one (unique) <a href="registration.html">registration</a> is required for each
                accepted paper to be included in the final proceedings.
                When registering, don't forget to indicate the paper ID.
        
            </p>
            <h2>Copyright</h2>
            <p>The corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must
                complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form.
                A pre-filled Springer copyright form can be <a
                    href="licence-to-publish.docx">found here</a>.
                The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the
                paper.
                Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be
                made.</p>
            <p>Please upload a signed and completed copyright form using the link you received by mail.
                You can scan the form into PDF or any other standard image format.
                Springer does not accept digital signatures on the copyright right forms at present.</p>
            <p>Authors employed by US Government contractors or US Government departments may have to sign an
                alternative form.
                It is imperative that such authors contact their legal departments and also get in touch with us as soon
                as their paper has been accepted.</p>
            <p>It is essential that the copyright form is correct, so please check before sending the file.
                The corresponding author must sign the form on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper,
                having gained their permission to do so.
                S/He signs for and accepts responsibility for releasing the material on behalf of any and all
                co-authors.</p> -->
