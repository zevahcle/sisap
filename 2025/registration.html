            Registration to SISAP 2025 provides access to all three days of the conference, including breakfast, 
            lunch, coffee breaks, the conference banquet, and the Newport social outing. <b>Please note that each accepted
            paper is expected to have one author with a full registration</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, either a Regular registration or 
            a Student registratrion.

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            
            One-day registration provides access to a single day of the conference, perfect for local people who would
            like to attend select presentations or keynote. The admission includes the meals and coffee breaks,
            but <b>does not</b> provide access to the conference banquet or the Newport outing. The specific day must be 
            chosen at the time of purchase, so please refer to the <a href="program.html">conference program</a>. <b>A person 
            is limited to only a single one-day registration</b>, so those who would like to attend multiple days must purchase
            a full registration.
