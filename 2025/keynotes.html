      <p><b>Title:</b> Scalable Methods for Visual Data Representation, Search, and Visualization  
        </p>
        <i><p><b>Abstract:</b> 
        Large visual datasets are increasingly common, demanding efficient systems for retrieval and exploration. This talk will present recent methods for handling such data, including leveraging large visual encoders to generate compact, high-quality descriptors. It will cover strategies to enhance cross-modal retrieval and explore approximate nearest neighbor search techniques, focusing on graph-based methods for dynamic datasets. Visualization approaches for high-dimensional data, like grid-based sorting, will also be demonstrated for intuitive navigation. Grid sorting requires efficient methods for such large datasets. Therefore, we introduce a parameter-efficient approach to learning permutations, requiring only N parameters for N objects. This method iteratively refines permutations, offering scalability for applications such as image sorting, graph optimization, or combinatorial tasks like solving Sudokus.

      <p><b>Title:</b> Graph-based algorithms for similarity search: challenges and opportunities</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
      <p>
        Over the last few years, graph-based approaches to nearest neighbor search have gained renewed interest. 
        Algorithms such as HNSW, NSG, and DiskANN have become popular tools in practice. These algorithms are highly 
        versatile and come equipped with efficient implementations. At the same time, the theoretical guarantees of 
        these algorithms are relatively limited. For instance, it has been observed (Indyk, Xu '23) that there exist 
        simple low-dimensional datasets for which most of these algorithms exhibit query times that scale linearly with 
        the dataset size. In this talk, I will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities presented by this class 
        of algorithms.

      <p><b>Title:</b> Embeddings of and for the mind</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
      <p>
        A variety of domains, including images, text, consumer choice, and brain activity, can be captured in embedding 
        spaces. In this talk, I will consider how to collect very large semantic embeddings from human similarity 
        judgments. We can use these embeddings to evaluate how well deep learning models align with humans. One 
        conclusion is that models that tend to be better from an engineering standpoint are worse as models of humans. 
        Should unconstrained embeddings or embeddings constrained to be non-negative should be preferred? I'll suggest 
        there is a tradeoff in which non-negative embeddings, which tend to be more interpretable, are worse for encoding 
        information but better for decoding. In the second part of the talk, I will consider whether agents can learn in 
        an unsupervised manner by aligning embeddings across modalities (<i>e.g.</i>, images and words) by respecting parallel 
        similarity relations across domains. I'll present evidence that adults spontaneously align modalities during 
        learning and that children rapidly learn new words through this alignment process.

      <p><b>Title:</b> Towards massive scale similarity search</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
      <p>
      Beyond the traditional search and recommendation tasks in massive datasets, the recent revolution in deep learning
      and Large Language models (LLMs) is driving huge interest in efficient search in large databases. Fast search is 
      proving to be essential for new applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generative AI (RAG) in addition to enabling 
      efficient variants of LLMs. Most of these applications need fast techniques for Maximum Inner Product Search 
      (MIPS). In this talk, I will describe the design of new techniques that effectively combine data partitioning with
      compression to achieve the state-of-the-art MIPS search. We have open-sourced the resulting system (ScaNN) which 
      is used extensively by the external community. I will conclude with open questions in the area of similarity 
      search and a discussion on other emerging alternatives such as generative retrieval based on LLMs.
