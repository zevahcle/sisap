            <li>Do not include acknowledgements in the manuscript.</li>
            <li>Remove identifying information from the body of your work and from the file metadata (e.g., author name in PDF properties).</li>
            <li>Ensure that figures and tables do not include or reference author affiliations.</li>
            <li>Double-check all files for unintended identifying details before submission.</li>

        is made either at the time of submission to SISAP, or before submission to the journal (whichever occurs later);
        that the journal also allows dual submission; and that the journal version not be published before the SISAP
        conference date.

        the two versions.</p>
