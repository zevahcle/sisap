  <p>
        Short Biographical Sketch<br>
Alistair Moffat has been involved in research in text compression
and information retrieval for more than three decades, and has
published numerous papers in the areas of index compression, text
compression, and dynamic pruning mechanisms, all of which help
support efficient ranked querying.  Alistair is a co-author of the
1991 (revised 1994) book Managing Gigabytes, and also co-author of
the 2002 book Compression and Coding Algorithms.  Much of Alistair's
recent work has examined the issue of IR system evaluation, and,
with other co-authors in Australia, he has focused on the relationship
between models of user interactions with search results pages, and
the effectiveness metrics that those interactions correspond to.
Alistair was co-Chair for SIGIR 1998 in Melbourne, and for CIKM
2015, also held in Melbourne; and co-Program Committee Chair for
SIGIR 2005 (Salvador, Brazil) and SIGIR 2015 (Santiago, Chile).
WSDM, to be held in Melbourne in February 2019, is Alistair's next
conference project.
</p>
<p>
  Alistair has been a teaching/research faculty member at the University
of Melbourne for thirty years, and was Department Chair from
2007-2011.  During that time he has taught programming skills to
well in excess of 15,000 undergraduate students, has authored a C
programming textbook (Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction
with C, 2002, revised 2012), and has received awards for his teaching
and lecturing skills.
</p>
<p>

Alistair's PhD was completed in 1985, at the University of Canterbury,
in New Zealand, in the area of shortest path algorithms.

University of Maryland, College Park. He received the B.S. degree in
engineering from UCLA, and the M.S. Degree in operations research and
the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Stanford
University. His doctoral dissertation dealt with proving the
correctness of translations of LISP programs which was the first work
in translation validation and the related concept of proof-carrying code.  </P>
<p>
He is the author of the recent book "Foundations of Multidimensional
and Metric Data Structures" published by Morgan-Kaufmann, an imprint
of Elsevier, in 2006, an award winner in the 2006 best book in
Computer and Information Science competition of the Professional and
Scholarly Publishers (PSP) Group of the American Publishers
Association (AAP), and of the first two books on spatial data
structures "Design and Analysis of Spatial Data Structures", and
Applications of Spatial Data Structures: Computer Graphics, Image
Processing, and GIS", both published by Addison-Wesley in 1990.

He is the Founding Editor-In-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Spatial
Algorithms and Systems (TSAS), the founding chair of ACM SIGSPATIAL,
a recipient of the 2009 UCGIS Research Award, 2011 ACM Paris
Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award, the IEEE Computer Society's
2014 Wallace McDowell Award, and a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE, AAAS,
IAPR (International Association for Pattern Recognition), and UCGIS.
He received best paper awards in the 2007 Computers & Graphics
Journal, the 2008 ACM SIGMOD and SIGSPATIAL Conferences, the 2012
SIGSPATIAL MobiGIS Workshop, the 2013 SIGSPATIAL GIR Workshop, as
well as best demo paper awards at the 2011 and 2016 ACM SIGSPATIAL
Conferences, and one of the best papers in the 2009 IEEE ICDE
Conference selected for publication in IEEE TKDE.  He was elected to
the ACM Council as the Capitol Region Representative for the term
1989-1991, and was an ACM Distinguished Speaker during 2008-2015.

<p> TITLE: 
      Humans, Machines, and Work: The Future is Now<br>

      ABSTRACT: 
      Automation, driven by technological progress, has been increasing
      inexorably for the past several decades. Two schools of economic
      thinking have for many years been engaged in a debate about the
      potential effects of automation on jobs: will new technology spawn mass unemployment, as the robots take jobs away from humans? Or will the jobs robots take over create demand for new human jobs?
</p><p>
      I will present data that demonstrate that the concerns about automation
      are valid. In fact, technology has been hurting working Americans for
      the past 40 years. The discussion about humans, machines and work
      tends to be a discussion about some undetermined point in the far
      future. But it is time to face reality. The future is now.
</p><p>
      Of particular interest to computer scientists is the question of
      computer science jobs. I will describe some recent progress in
      artificial intelligence towards the automation of programming.
