<h2 id="venue"><strong> Additional Information: Location and Venue</strong></h2>
<p>SISAP 2018 will take place in <strong>Lima</strong>, the capital of Peru. The area around Lima had already been inhabited for centuries when Spanish troops founded the city in 1535. In 1542 it was made the seat of the Viceroyalty of Peru, which contained most of Spanish-ruled South America, and in 1551 the oldest continuously-functioning university in the Americas was founded there. Lima is located on the Pacific coast and is famed for its beaches and cuisine. October is early spring and the temperatures are usually around 20 degrees Celsius or 68 degrees Fahrenheit, both highs and lows.</p>
<p>There are direct <strong>flights</strong> from New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Mexico City, Madrid, Paris, Amsterdam and many major cities in South America, and visitors from Asia and Oceania can arrive via Santiago de Chile, for example.</p>

<h2>Peru</h2>


Peru is a country in western South America. It borders on the north with Ecuador and Colombia, on the east with Brazil, on the southeast with Bolivia, on the south with Chile and on the west with the Pacific Ocean.
Peruvian territory was home to ancient cultures that span from the civilization of Caral in Caral, one of the oldest in the world, to the Inca Empire, the largest state in pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty with capital in Lima, which included most of its South American colonies.

Peru is a presidential representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions. Its geography varies from the arid plains of the Pacific coast to the peaks of the Andes mountains and the tropical rainforest of the Amazon basin. Its main economic activities are agriculture, fishing, mining and the manufacture of products such as textiles.

The Peruvian population, estimated at 30.4 million, is multi-ethnic. The main language is Spanish, although a significant number of Quechua Peruvians or other native languages. This mixture of cultural traditions results in a wide variety of expressions in fields such as art, cooking, literature and music.


<h2>Lima</h2>


Lima is the capital city of the Republic of Peru, located on the central coast of the country, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, forming an extensive and populous urban area known as Lima Metropolitan, flanked by the coastal desert and spread over the valleys of the Chillon, Rimac and Lurin rivers. According to the Peruvian census of 2007, Lima had more than 7.6 million inhabitants, note 1 while its urban agglomeration had more than 8.5 million inhabitants, 30% of the Peruvian population, figures that make it the most populated city in the country.
