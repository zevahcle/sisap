<h1>Special Sessions – SISAP 2021</h1>
<p>For SISAP 2021, we call for contributions for the following two special sessions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Similarity Search in Graph-Structured Data (SISEG)</strong>, organized by Nils Kriege, University of Vienna, Austria</li>
  <li><strong>Semantics-Based Search</strong>, organized by Richard Connor, University of St Andrews, Scotland, UK,
Alan Dearle, University of St Andrews, Scotland, UK,
Lia Morra, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy,
and Lucia Vadicamo, CNR Pisa, Pisa, Italy</li>
</ul>
<p>Special session papers will supplement the regular research papers and be
included in the proceedings of SISAP 2021, which will be
published by Springer as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series.</p>
<p>Special session submissions may include vision/position papers, which will be
evaluated based on the quality of the arguments and ideas proposed in the
papers. In order to ensure high quality of the conference papers, all papers
submitted to special sessions will be peer-reviewed, including papers solicited
by the special session chairs. If a special session has many high-quality
submissions, some of the submissions may potentially be moved to regular
sessions; likewise, relevant accepted submissions may be moved into special
sessions.</p>
<h2>Similarity Search in Graph-Structured Data (SISEG)</h2>
<p><em>Organized by Nils Kriege, University of Vienna, Austria</em></p>
<p>Graphs are a versatile data structure for representing structured objects such as molecules in computational
drug discovery [4, 1], proteins and their interaction networks in bioinformatics [6], scene graphs in
computer vision, social networks, and knowledge graphs. Analyzing the large amounts of data in these
domains often involves defining a similarity measure on graphs (or nodes). The complex structure and
heterogeneity of the graphs appearing in real-world applications makes their comparison challenging.
Various concepts for this have been proposed including general-purpose and domain-specific approaches.
These can be divided into techniques based on graph matching and graph embedding. Graph matching
refers to methods finding a mapping between the nodes of two graphs that preserves the adjacency
structure. Widely used methods are based on the graph edit distance [5, 3], the maximum common
subgraph problem [1], and network alignment [6]. Similarity search regarding measures from graph
matching is challenging, since the underlying graph problems are typically NP-hard, and the properties
of a metric are not necessarily satisfied but depend on subtle differences in definition. Graph embedding
methods map graphs into a vector space, such that similar graphs are mapped to close vectors. This
renders standard approaches possible for graph data and significantly simplifies the problem of similarity
search. Various general-purpose embedding techniques exist including graph kernels [2] and graph neural
networks [7] developed for machine learning with graphs. Moreover, application-specific techniques
have a long history, e.g., chemical fingerprints for representing molecules [4]. With the growing amount
of available heterogeneous graph-structured data, similarity search becomes increasingly important.</p>

<h2>Semantics-Based Search</h2>
<p><em>Organized by Richard Connor, University of St Andrews, Scotland, UK

Lucia Vadicamo, CNR Pisa, Pisa, Italy</em></p>
<p>Most work in similarity search takes place in a domain far distant from the actual semantics of a
space. Given a metric and a set of values, there is a wealth of research in how to efficiently
perform search. However almost without exception, the aspect of mapping the results to the
“real” closeness semantic the metric is intended to model is ignored. In part, this is often due to
the lack of an unbiased ground truth, which is extremely difficult to establish in large collections.
Within this context, large scale near-duplicate detection provides a realistic and challenging task
on which different techniques can be compared. On one hand, it entails a subtle differentiation
between actual near duplicates, and image pairs which are visually similar, but not semantically
related. On the other hand, since the number of image pairs grows quadratically with the size of
the collection, it requires both effective and computationally efficient search techniques.</p>
<p>MirFlickr1M is a collection of one million images. Collected for research purposes as a
benchmark for image tagging, the original selection of images was guided by certain factors, but
no checking for similarity was performed at the time. By chance, however, a large number of
near-duplicate clusters do occur, along with a small set of identical image clusters. These similar
images exist for “natural” reasons. As an example, some are images of the same highly
predictable subject and context (for example the moon); some are alterations of others within
the collection after cropping, re-hueing etc., some are subsequent shots taken in quick
succession from a single camera, etc.</p>
<p>In the MirFlickr Near Duplicate (MFND) dataset, around 10,000 known similar clusters have
been identified and checked by the proposers of this Session. There is strong statistical
evidence that this is the large majority of all the near-duplicate images within the set. The
remainder of the collection therefore contains over 10 11 visually similar, but not semantically
related, image pairs. Hence, differentiating actual near-duplicate images from visually similar
images provides a subtle and challenging task.</p>
<h3>Purpose of the Session</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this session is to allow fair and immediate comparisons among different
techniques with respect to the well-defined semantic ground truth. Near-duplicate image
detection is an important similarity task in its own right. More generally however the provision of
a semantic ground truth over a large collection allows comparison of techniques in a domain
where scalability is crucial, as judged by the semantic outcome. For example one aspect,
usually unmentioned in similarity research, is the importance of false positive results: the
number of objects in a collection which are similar to a given query is very unlikely to be uniform,
and most research completely fails to address this issue.</p>
<p>We are not proposing a challenge to find the best technique, but only a framework in which
different techniques may be meaningfully compared. For example, a very efficient technique
with relatively low recall but a low false positive rate may, for some tasks, be more useful than a
less scalable one with better recall, or indeed than a faster outcome with more false positives.
However any of these three may be most appropriate for a given context.</p>
<p>Research topics that could benefit or be applied to the MFND benchmark include, but are not
limited, to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comparison of novel or existing methods for exact and approximate search strategies</li>
  <li>Feature extraction for near-duplicate and semantic similarity search</li>
  <li>Novel distance metrics for semantic similarity search and near-duplicate detection</li>
  <li>Machine learning methods for semantic similarity search</li>
  <li>Efficient methods for indexing and range/threshold-based queries</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions providing novel insights on the population characteristics of the MFND collection, or existing similar collections, are also welcome.</p>
<h3>Facilities available</h3>
<p>The MirFlickr image collection is <a href="http://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/mirdownload.html">published and available</a>, along with a set of image
representations such as MPEG7 features, edge and texture histograms, GIST and SIFT. The
identities of duplicate and two classes of near-duplicate images are <a href="http://mfnd.similarity.eu/">available from the
proposers</a>. We also have representations of the FC6 layer derived from AlexNet, as well as the
last convolutional layers of ResNet152 and VGG16, all of which will be made available for

analyses based on distances can also be provided.</p>
