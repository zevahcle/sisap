<h1>Call for Submissions – SISAP 2021 Doctoral Symposium</h1>
<p><strong>Third Doctoral Symposium on Similarity Search and Applications</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sisap.org/2021/doctoralsymposium.html">https://sisap.org/2021/doctoralsymposium.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Co-located with the main SISAP 2021 conference</strong></p>
<p>Dortmund, Germany, Sept 29 – Oct 1, 2021</p>
<h2>Call for Submissions</h2>
<p>SISAP 2021 Doctoral Symposium provides a forum for PhD students to present
their research ideas and receive feedback from senior members of the research
community. The Symposium fosters a collaborative environment, encouraging
constructive discussions and sharing of ideas.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions from active PhD students devoted to all issues
surrounding the theory, design, analysis, practice, and application of
content-based and feature-based similarity search who are in early/mid stage of
their research and that are expecting to graduate in more than one year.
You will find a detailed list of possible topics of interest on the SISAP 2021
conference website:</p>
<p><a href="https://sisap.org/2021/callforpapers.html">https://sisap.org/2021/callforpapers.html</a></p>
<p>Submissions from students who are in the early stages of their research should
provide a clear statement of the problem being addressed, and a clear outline
of the planned methodology. Submissions from students who are in the mid stage
of their research should clearly state the contributions made so far, and the
work lying ahead.</p>
<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Paper submission deadline: ‘'’July 19, 2021 (AoE)’’’</li>
  <li>Notification of acceptance: August 4, 2021</li>
  <li>Camera-ready submission due: August 11, 2021</li>
  <li>Pre-recorded Presentation: September 15, 2021</li>
  <li>Conference: September 29—October 1, 2021</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>A submission to the doctoral symposium consists of a paper and an additional
1-page appendix (both in PDF format). Submissions must be single author and
written by the student alone. The paper should be no longer than 5 pages
(plus references) and should be formatted with the same rules as SISAP papers.
You will find these rules summarized on the SISAP 2021 conference website:</p>
<p><a href="https://sisap.org/2021/guidelines.html">https://sisap.org/2021/guidelines.html</a></p>
<p>The manuscripts should contain the statement of the problem being addressed, an
outline of the planned methodology, contributions made so far, and the work
lying ahead. It is anticipated that the thesis work has been published
elsewhere, or submitted for publication, and, in particular, concurrent
submission of a regular paper to SISAP with technical contributions is
encouraged.</p>
<p>In addition to the paper, the applicants are expected to provide a 1-page
Appendix that should describe the benefits that would be obtained by attending
the doctoral symposium, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A statement by the student saying why they want to attend the Doctoral Symposium.</li>
  <li>A statement by their advisor saying how the student would benefit by
attending the  Doctoral Symposium.</li>
  <li>Advisors should also specifically state whether the student has written, or
is close to completing, a thesis proposal (or equivalent) and when they
expect the student would defend their dissertation if they progress at a
typical rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors should submit a zip file containing the paper and the appendix in PDF
format through the EasyChair conference management system:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2021">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2021</a></p>
<p>SISAP 2021 Doctoral Symposium papers will be published as part of
the SISAP 2021 proceedings.</p>
<h2>Review Process</h2>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed by the Doctoral Symposium Program Committee
(appointed by the Doctoral Symposium Chair). The review and decision of
acceptance will balance many factors. This includes the topic and the quality
of your proposal, quality of presentation, potential for future impact of the
research on the field and expected benefit to the other doctoral students
attending the conference. It also includes external factors, such as ensuring
that as a group the accepted candidates exhibit a diversity of backgrounds and
topics.</p>
<p>Candidates who have a clearly developed idea, who are formally considered by
their institution to be working on their dissertation, and who still have time
to be influenced by participation in the PhD Doctoral Symposium will receive
the strongest consideration.</p>
<h2>Further Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The author of the best Doctoral Symposium paper will receive an award during
the conference banquet, along with a travel grant of €500
given to the student directly. The conference organizers may give travel grants
to other Doctoral Symposium participants if the budget allows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PhD students of the accepted Doctoral Symposium papers coming at the
conference to present solely their Doctoral Symposium paper will be entitled
to a student registration fee for the entire conference.</p>
  </li>
