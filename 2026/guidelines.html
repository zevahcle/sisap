                <h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
                <p>SISAP 2026 allows for four forms of submissions: <strong> long research papers</strong> (from 9 to 14 pages), <strong>short research
                        papers</strong> (of up to 8 pages), <strong>demonstration papers</strong> (of up to 8 pages), and <strong>doctoral symposium papers</strong> (up to 6 pages plus 2 pages of references).
                    The submission itself, including references, should fit within these page limits.
                </p>

                <h2>Presentation</h2>
                <p>By submitting a paper, its authors <strong>commit to its presentation at the conference (i.e., in person)</strong> in the event that the paper is
                    accepted. For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, at least one of its authors must register for the
                    conference.
                    <!-- At SISAP 2026, all research papers will be presented both orally and in a poster session. -->
                    The demonstations will be presented in a poster session.<!-- - posters should be prepared for these as well. -->
                    For the doctoral symposium, the accepted papers will be presented in a dedicated session.
                    All  papers will be given an entry in the conference proceedings.</p>
                <h2>Formatting your submission</h2>
                <p>Papers submitted to SISAP 2026 must be written in English and formatted according to the <a
                        href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">LNCS
                        guidelines</a>.
                    <!--         Springer encourages authors to include their ORCID id in their papers. -->

                <p><b>Papers have to be submitted in PDF format through <a href=https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sisap2026 target="_blank">EasyChair</a>.</b></p>


                <h2>Research papers (regular and special session)</h2>
                <p>
                    <!--- The submission itself, including references, should fit within
                  these page limits. Authors may add an appendix with supplementary material, to
                  be read at the discretion of the PC. --->
                    Full papers  (from 9 to 14 pages) are expected to be descriptions of complete technical work, whereas short papers (of up to 8 pages) can describe
                    innovative approaches or preliminary results which may nevertheless require more work to mature.
                    Page limits include references. Any appendices, if needed, can only be posted online, and the reviewers are not expected to take them into account.
                    Vision papers and other position papers should be submitted as short research papers.
                </p><p>
                    Regular and special session research papers  will be peer-reviewed in a <strong>double-blind</strong> review process. 
                    <strong>Authors must ensure their manuscripts are properly anonymized.</strong>
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Abstract submission
                </h3>
                Submit your abstract by entering the metadata (title, authors, and an abstract
                of 150-300 words) via <a href=" https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2026"> EasyChair</a>.
                When submitting, please select the <i>'Regular and Special Session Papers'</i> track.</p>

                <h3>Guidelines for Anonymizing Your Submission</h3>
                <p>
                    To support double-blind review, remove all identifying information from your manuscript and supplementary materials, including:
                </p>    
                <ul>
                    <li>Author's names</li>
                    <li>Institutional affiliations</li>
                    <li>Email addresses</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Additionally, ensure that you prepare your manuscript correctly for double anonymous peer review by considering the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the third person when referencing your own previous work. For example, write “Brown and Smith (2015) demonstrated...” instead of “We previously demonstrated...”</li>
                    <li>Do not include acknowledgements in the manuscript.</li>
                    <li>Remove identifying information from the body of your work and from the file metadata (e.g., author name in PDF properties).</li>
                    <li>Ensure that figures and tables do not include or reference author affiliations.</li>
                    <li>Double-check all files for unintended identifying details before submission.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Anonymization applies only to the <strong>PDF</strong> of the paper. In the submission system, provide full author names and affiliations, which will remain hidden from reviewers.
                </p>

                <h2>Demonstration papers</h2>
                <p>Demonstartion papers (of up to 8 pages) should provide the motivation for the demonstrated concepts, the information about the
                    technology and the system to be demonstrated (including a system description, functionality and figures when
                    applicable), and should state the significance of the contribution.
                    The scenarios within which the demonstration applies should also be explained.
                    Evaluation criteria for the demonstration proposals include: novelty, technical advances and challenges, and the
                    overall practical attractiveness of the demonstrated system.
                    A demonstration submission consists of a paper and an additional 1-page appendix (in PDF format) that illustrate how the demo will be conducted on-site at SISAP.
                    This additional content will not be published in the conference proceedings, should the submission be accepted. </p>
                <p>Authors should submit two separate files– one for the paper (uploaded to the ‘Paper’ field)  and one for the appendix (uploaded to the ‘Additional Information’ field)- in PDF through the <a href=" https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2026"> EasyChair</a> conference management system.
                    When submitting, please select the <i>'SISAP2026 Demonstrations'</i> track.</p><p>
                    Demonstartion papers will be peer-reviewed in a  <strong>single-blind</strong> review process.

                </p>

                <h2>Doctoral Symposium papers</h2>
                <p>
                    A submission to the doctoral symposium consists of a paper and an additional 1-page appendix (both in PDF format). 
                    The paper should be no longer than 6 pages (plus up to 2 pages of references) and should be formatted with the same rules as SISAP papers.
                    The additional 1-page appendix will not be published in the conference proceedings, should the submission be accepted.
                    Submissions must be single-author and written by the student alone. 
                <p>Authors should submit two separate files–  one for the paper (uploaded to the ‘Paper’ field) and one for the appendix (uploaded to the ‘Additional Information’ field)-  through
                    <a href=" https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2026" target="_blank"> EasyChair</a>. When submitting, please select the <i>'SISAP 2026 Doctoral Symposium'</i> track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The doctoral symposium papers will be peer-reviewed in a  <strong>single-blind</strong> review process.
                </p>



                <h2>Dual submission policy</h2>

                <p>Submitted papers must not be previously published, and must not be under consideration by any other conference
                    during the SISAP review process.
                    Dual submission of a substantially extended version to a journal will be considered, provided that this request
                    is made either at the time of submission to SISAP, or before submission to the journal (whichever occurs later);
                    that the journal also allows dual submission; and that the journal version not be published before the SISAP
                    conference date.
                    The authors must clearly identify the journal in question, and provide a statement of the differences between
                    the two versions.</p>

                <h2>Publication</h2>
                <p>The proceedings of SISAP shall be published by Springer as a volume in the <a
                        href="http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs">Lecture Notes in Computer Science</a> (LNCS) series.
                    The conference will also confer a Best Paper Award, as judged by the Program Committee Co-Chairs and Steering
                    Committee.
                </p>
