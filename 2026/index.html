            <h1>18th International Conference on <br/> Similarity Search and Applications, SISAPÂ 2025</h1>

            <p>The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for
                researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the
                technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information
                retrieval, multimedia retrieval, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography,
                biometrics, machine learning, and many others that need similarity searching as a necessary supporting
                service. [*] Please see the <a href="./callforpapers.html">call for papers</a>  for more details.</p>

            <p>SISAP 2025 also features a  <a href="./doctoralsymposium.html"><strong>doctoral symposium</strong></a>. If you are a PhD student, please consider
                submitting a paper about your project.</p> 

            <p>The SISAP initiative (<a href="https://www.sisap.org/">www.sisap.org</a>) is a forum to exchange
                real-world, challenging and innovative examples of applications, new indexing techniques, common
                test-beds and benchmarks, source code and up-to-date literature through its web page, serving the
                similarity search community. Traditionally, SISAP puts emphasis on the distance-based searching, but in
                general the conference concerns both the effectiveness and efficiency aspects of any similarity search
                problem.</p>
            <p>SISAP is recognized as a <strong>CORE B</strong> conference. The series started in 2008 as a workshop and has developed over the years into an international
                conference with <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs">Springer Lecture Notes in
                    Computer Science (LNCS)</a> proceedings. You can find links to past SISAP proceedings on 
                    <a href="https://link.springer.com/conference/sisap"><strong>SpringerLink</strong></a>. 
                    

              <p>A small selection of the best papers presented at the conference will be recommended for inclusion in a
                special issue of <strong>Elsevier <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems/"> Information
                    Systems</a></strong>. These extended versions will be subject to a second round of peer review at the
                journal.</p>  
                <p>
                    There will be a <strong>Best Paper Award</strong>. The best papers will be recognized with a certificate and a monetary prize, thanks to 
                    <strong>Springer</strong>'s sponsorship.
                </p>
            <p>SISAP 2025 will take place at <strong>Reykjavik University (RU) Reykjavik, Iceland</strong>.

           <!--    <p>SISAP 2025 will follow a double-blind review process, meaning reviewers 
                will not know the names of the authors and the authors will not know the names of their reviewers. Author 
                submission guidelines will be released soon.</p> -->

            <!-- <p><em>Did you know:</em> Bologna is the seventh most populous city in Italy with about 400,000 inhabitants.
It is known as the Fat, Red, and the Learn'd City due to its rich cuisine, red Spanish tiled rooftops, and being home to the oldest university in the western world (established in AD 1088).
In 2000 it was declared European capital of culture and in 2006, a UNESCO "City of Music" and became part of the Creative Cities Network.
In 2021 UNESCO recognized the lengthy porticoes of the city as a World Heritage Site.</p> -->
