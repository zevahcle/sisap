                <p><b>Bio:</b>
                    Josef Sivic is a distinguished researcher at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics (CIIRC) at the Czech Technical University in Prague, where he leads the Intelligent Machine Perception group and the ELLIS Unit Prague. He is currently on leave from a senior researcher position at Inria Paris, where he remains an external collaborator with the Willow team. Josef received his PhD from the University of Oxford in 2006 under the supervision of Professor Andrew Zisserman, followed by a postdoctoral appointment at MIT’s CSAIL with Professor William Freeman, and obtained his habilitation degree from École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 2014.
                    His research lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with a particular focus on learning visual representations from large-scale, weakly supervised, and multimodal data. He has made influential contributions to visual recognition, image and video retrieval, semantic segmentation, visual localization, geometric matching, and 3D understanding, as well as to learning from videos, narrated data, and demonstrations for embodied and robotic tasks. His work has been published in top venues such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, and TPAMI. He has an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NCtKHnQAAAAJ" target="_blank" title="Google Scholar profile">outstanding publication record</a>, with an h-index of 82 and roughly 60,000 citations.
