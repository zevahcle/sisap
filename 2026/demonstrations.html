                <h1>Call for Demonstration Submissions</h1>
                <p>The organizers of SISAP 2026 cordially invite authors to submit novel and compelling demonstrations on any of our <a href="./topic-of-interest.html"> topic of interest </a>. As we are seeking to maximize the on-site impact and experience for our attendees the demonstration submissions will be evaluated not only on novelty and academic impact but also on the interestingness and on-site impact. The evaluation criteria will include: novelty, technical advances and challenges, the overall practical attractiveness and potential on-site impact of the system.</p>
                <p>A demonstration submission shall consist of a paper (of up to 8 pages including references) and a mandatory additional appendix (1 page in PDF format) that shall explain and/or illustrate how the demonstration will be conducted on-site. This additional 1-page appendix will not be published in the conference proceedings but is important in the review process and for the organisation of the demonstration session. Demonstration papers will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind review process.</p>
                <p>The conference will provide a table, power outlet, a screen, wireless (shared) internet and a poster board. If authors have special needs (e.g., extra space, specific furniture etc.), please include all such information in the 1-page appendix and we will try to accommodate as best we can.</p>
                <p>Accepted demonstration papers will be presented in a dedicated session during the conference. The authors of accepted demonstration papers are expected to register for the conference and present their work in person.
                    If the presenting author of a Demonstration paper is also the presenting and registered author of an accepted SISAP research paper, then one registration will cover both presentations and no additional registration fee will be required for the Demonstration paper.</p>

                <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
                Authors should submit two separate files– one for the paper (uploaded to the ‘Paper’ field)  
                and one for the appendix (uploaded to the ‘Additional Information’ field)- in PDF through the EasyChair conference management system: <a href=" https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2026"> https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2026</a>.
                When submitting, please select the <i>'SISAP2026 Demonstrations'</i> track.
