                <h1>Call for Demonstration Submissions</h1>
                <p>The organizers of SISAP 2026 cordially invite authors to submit novel and compelling demonstrations on any of our <a href="./topic-of-interest.html"> topic of interest </a>. As we are seeking to maximize the on-site impact and experience for our attendees the demonstration submissions will be evaluated not only on novelty and academic impact but also on the interestingness and on-site impact. The evaluation criteria will include: novelty, technical advances and challenges, the overall practical attractiveness and potential on-site impact of the system.</p>
                <p>A demonstration submission shall consist of a paper (of up to 8 pages including references) and a mandatory additional appendix (1 page in PDF format) that shall explain and/or illustrate how the demonstration will be conducted on-site. This additional 1-page appendix will not be published in the conference proceedings but is important in the review process and for the organisation of the demonstration session. Demonstration papers will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind review process.</p>
                <p>The conference will provide a table, power outlet, a screen, wireless (shared) internet and a poster board. If authors have special needs (e.g., extra space, specific furniture etc.), please include all such information in the 1-page appendix and we will try to accommodate as best we can.</p>
                <p>Accepted demonstration papers will be presented in a dedicated session during the conference. The authors of accepted demonstration papers are expected to register for the conference and present their work in person.
                    If the presenting author of a Demonstration paper is also the presenting and registered author of an accepted SISAP research paper, then one registration will cover both presentations and no additional registration fee will be required for the Demonstration paper.</p>

                <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
                Authors should submit two separate files– one for the paper (uploaded to the ‘Paper’ field)  
                and one for the appendix (uploaded to the ‘Additional Information’ field)- in PDF through the EasyChair conference management system: <a href=" https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2026"> https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2026</a>.
                When submitting, please select the <i>'SISAP2026 Demonstrations'</i> track.

                <!--   <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
                   <p>A submission to the doctoral symposium consists of a paper and an additional 1-page appendix (both in PDF
                  format).
                  Submissions must be single-author and written by the student alone.
                  The paper should be no longer than 5 pages (plus references) and should be formatted with the same rules as
                  SISAP papers.
                  You will find these rules summarised on the SISAP 2022 conference website:</p>
                <p><a href="https://sisap.org/2023/guidelines.html">https://sisap.org/2023/guidelines.html</a></p>
                <p>The manuscripts should contain the statement of the problem being addressed, an outline of the planned
                  methodology, contributions made so far, and the work lying ahead.
                  It is anticipated that the thesis work has been published elsewhere or submitted for publication, and concurrent
                  submission of a regular paper to SISAP with technical contributions is encouraged.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper, the applicants are expected to provide a 1-page Appendix that should describe the
                  benefits that would be obtained by attending the doctoral symposium, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A statement by the student saying why they want to attend the Doctoral Symposium.</li>
                  <li>A statement by their advisor saying how the student would benefit by attending the Doctoral Symposium.</li>
                  <li>Advisors should also specifically state whether the student has written, or is close to completing, a thesis
                    proposal (or equivalent) and when they
                    expect the student would defend their dissertation if they progress at a typical rate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Authors should submit a zip file containing the paper and the appendix in PDF format through the EasyChair
                  conference management system:</p>
                <p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2023">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2023</a>
                </p>
                <p>SISAP 2023 Doctoral Symposium papers will be published as part of the SISAP 2023 proceedings.</p>
          
                <h2>Review Process</h2>
                <p>Submissions will be reviewed by the Doctoral Symposium Program Committee (appointed by the Doctoral Symposium
                  Chair). The review and decision of acceptance will balance many factors. This includes the topic and the quality
                  of your proposal, quality of presentation, potential for future impact of the research on the field and expected
                  benefit to the other doctoral students attending the conference. It also includes external factors, such as
                  ensuring that as a group the accepted candidates exhibit a diversity of backgrounds and topics.
                  Candidates who have a clearly developed idea, who are formally considered by their institution to be working on
                  their dissertation, and who still have time to be influenced by participation in the PhD Doctoral Symposium will
                  receive the strongest consideration.</p>
          
                <h2>Further Information</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The author of the best Doctoral Symposium paper will receive an award during the conference banquet, along
                    with a monetary prize given to the student directly.</li>
                  <li>PhD students of the accepted Doctoral Symposium papers coming at the conference to present solely their
                    Doctoral Symposium paper will be entitled
                    to a student registration fee for the entire conference.</li>
