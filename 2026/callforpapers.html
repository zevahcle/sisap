                <h2>Scope</h2>

                <p>The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia retrieval, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography, biometrics, machine learning, and many others that make use of similarity search as a necessary supporting service. From its roots in metric indexing, SISAP has expanded to become the only international conference entirely devoted to all issues surrounding the theory, design, analysis, practice, and application of content-based and feature-based similarity search. Since 2021, SISAP has been a  <strong>CORE Rank B</strong> conference.</p>

                <p>The conference proceedings will be published by Springer as a volume in the <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs">Springer Lecture Notes in
                        Computer Science</a>  (LNCS) series. 
                    A small selection of the best papers
                    presented at the conference will be recommended for
                    inclusion in a special issue of Information Systems. These extended versions will be subject to a second round
                    of peer review at the journal.
                </p>

                <!-- <p> SISAP 2025 will follow a <strong>double-blind review process</strong>, meaning reviewers
                  will not know the names of the authors and the authors will not know the names of their reviewers. </p> -->

                <h2>Types of papers</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#regular">Regular Papers:</a> 9 ‒ 14 pages (full papers), up to 8 pages (short papers)</li>
                    <li><a href="#special">Special Session Papers:</a> 9 ‒ 14 pages (full papers), up to 8 pages (short papers)</li>
                    <li><a href="#demo"> Demo papers:</a> up to 6 pages</li>

                </ul>

                <p>All papers have to be submitted in PDF LNCS format through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sisap2026">EasyChair</a>.  Please see the <a href="./guidelines.html">submission guidelines</a>.</p>


                <a name="regular"></a>
                <h2>Regular Papers</h2>
                <p>The organizers of SISAP 2026 call for novel and original research papers addressing <a href="./topics-of-interest.html">topics of interest</a> related to the conference. We encourage contributions both to theoretical aspects and applications.</p>
                <p>Full papers (from 9 to 14 pages) are expected to be descriptions of complete technical work, whereas short papers (of up to 8 pages) can describe innovative approaches or preliminary results which may nevertheless require more work to mature. 
                    Vision papers and other position papers should be submitted as short research papers.</p>
                <p>Page limits include references. Any appendices, if needed, can only be posted online, and the reviewers are not expected to take them into account.
                    Vision papers and other position papers should be submitted as short research papers.</p>
                <p>Regular papers will be peer-reviewed in a <strong>double-blind</strong> review process. Thus, the submissions must be properly anonymized.</p>

                <p>A small selection of the best papers presented at the conference will be recommended for inclusion in a
                    special issue of <strong>Elsevier <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems/"> Information Systems</a></strong>. These extended versions will be subject to a second round of peer review at the journal.</p>  
                <p>The <strong>Best Paper</strong> will be recognized with a certificate and a monetary prize, thanks to Springer's sponsorship.</p>

                <a name="special"></a>
                <h2>Special Sessions</h2>
                <p> Special sessions are mini-venues, each focusing on one state-of-the-art research direction as proposed by the research community.
                    The topics are within the field of similarity search, similarity management and applications that utilise the similarity.
                    <em> The <a href="./call4specialsession.html">call for Special Session Proposals</a> is now open!</em>
                </p>
                <p>Special session papers will supplement the regular research papers with generally the same requirements. They will be included in the same proceedings of the conference published by Springer.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the special session papers will be peer-reviewed in a <strong>double-blind</strong> review process. Thus, the submissions must be properly anonymized.</p>
                <!--For SISAP 2026, we call for contributions for the following two special sessions:
