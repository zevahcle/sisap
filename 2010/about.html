<h4>September 18.-19., 2010 - Istanbul, Turkey</h4><br />

<p>The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is a conference devoted to similarity searching, with emphasis on metric space searching.
It aims to fill in the gap left by the various scientific venues devoted to similarity searching in spaces with coordinates, by providing a common forum for theoreticians and practitioners around the problem of similarity searching in general spaces (metric and non-metric) or using distance-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) techniques in general.</p>

<p>SISAP aims to become an ideal forum to exchange real-world, challenging and exciting examples of applications, new indexing techniques, common testbeds and benchmarks, source code, and up-to-date literature through a web page serving the similarity searching community.
Authors are expected to use the testbeds and code from the SISAP web site for comparing new applications, databases, indexes and algorithms.</p>

<p>After the very successful first events in Cancun, Mexico (2008) and Prague, Czech Republic (2009), this year SISAP conference will be held in Istanbul, Turkey, on September 18-19, 2010.</p>

<p>The four best papers will be invited to be published in a special issue of Journal of Discrete Algorithms (Elsevier).
SISAP 2010 is organized in cooperation with ACM SIGSPATIAL and the papers are <a href="http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=1862344&idx=SERIES11623&type=proceeding&coll=ACM&dl=ACM&part=series&WantType=Proceedings&title=SISAP&CFID=103125561&CFTOKEN=63194649">indexed in the ACM Digital Library</a>.</p>
