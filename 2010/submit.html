	<li> Accepted poster papers are expected to be presented at the conference poster session. A suitable form of poster is a <b> large (A0-A1) piece of paper </b>  with concise schema sumarizing the paper contribution. We strongly discourage to use posters in form of printed papers.</li>
	<li> An accepted demo paper is expected to be presented at the conference demo session. The demo presentation will be performed on an on-site notebook (or the presenter's notebook) with a high-speed connection to internet. Optionally, there will be a data projector and a projection wall available.</li>
