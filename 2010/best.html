<h3>Best papers</h3>

<p>The editors of special issue of <a href=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/jda>Journal of Discrete Algorithms</a> (and SISAP 2010 co-chairs) selected the four best papers that were invited to the mentioned journal issue. The selected papers are (alphabetically order by the authors' name):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ole Edsberg and Magnus Lie Hetland: Indexing inexact proximity search with distance regression in pivot space</li>
	<li>Rui Mao, Willard Miranker and Daniel Miranker: Dimension Reduction for Distance-Based Indexing</li>
	<li>Jiri Novak, Tomas Skopal, David Hoksza and Jakub Lokoc: Improving the Similarity Search of Tandem Mass Spectra using Metric Access Methods</li>
	<li>Vladimir Pestov: Indexability, Concentration, and VC Theory</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision was based primarily on the ranks in reviews of the original SISAP submissions, on the oral presentation and on topic coverage.</p>
