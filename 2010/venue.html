<h3>Conference venue</h3>
<p>Located in the center of the Old World, Istanbul is one of the world's great cities famous for its historical monuments and magnificent scenic beauties.
It is the only city in the world which spreads over two continents: it lies at a point where Asia and Europe are separated by a narrow strait - the Bosphorus.
This year, Istanbul also holds the title of <a href=http://www.en.istanbul2010.org/>European Capital of Culture</a>.</p>
