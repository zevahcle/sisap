        <b>Title:</b> Data-Dependent Hashing for Similarity Search
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        The quest for efficient similarity search algorithms has lead to a
        number of ideas that proved successful in both theory and
        practice. Yet, the last decade or so has seen a growing gap between
        the theoretical and practical approaches. On the one hand, most
        successful theoretical methods rely on data-indepependent hashing,
        such as the classic Locality Sensitive Hashing scheme. These methods
        have provable guarantees on correctness and performance. On the other
        hand, in practice, methods that adapt to the given datasets, such as
        the PCA-tree, often outperform the former, but provide no guarantees
        on performance or correctness.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This talk will survey the recent efforts to bridge this gap between
        theoretical and practical methods for similarity search. We will see
        that data-dependent methods are provably better than data-independent
        methods, giving, for instance, the first improvements over the
        Locality Sensitive Hashing schemes for the Hamming and Euclidean
        spaces.

        Alexandr Andoni's research focuses on advancing algorithmic
        foundations of massive data, with interests revolving around sublinear
        algorithms, high-dimensional geometry, and theoretical machine
        learning.  Alexandr is an associate professor at the Columbia
        University and a member of the Columbia's Data Science Institute.  He
        graduated from MIT in 2009, with a PhD thesis on Nearest Neighbor
        Search, under the supervision of Piotr Indyk. Following graduation, he
        was a postdoc at the Center for Computational Intractability at
        Princeton, as well as a visitor at NYU and IAS. Alexandr then joined
        Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, where he was a researcher until
        2014. Afterwards, Alexandr was a visiting scientist at the Simons
        Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley.

        <b>Title:</b> Defying the Gravity of Learning Curves: Are More Samples Better
        for Nearest Neighbor Anomaly Detectors?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        Machine learning algorithms are conventionally considered to provide higher accuracy when more data
        are used for their training. We call this behavior of their learning curves "the gravity", and it
        is believed that no learning algorithms are "gravity-defiant". A few scholars recently suggested
        that some unsupervised anomaly detector ensembles follow the gravity defiant learning curves. One
        explained this behavior in terms of the sensitivity of the expected k-nearest neighbor distances to
        the data density. Another discussed the former's incorrect reasoning, and demonstrated the
        possibilities of both gravity-compliance and gravity-defiant behaviors by applying the statistical
        bias-variance analysis. However, the bias-variance analysis for density estimation error is not an
        appropriate tool for anomaly detection error. In this talk, we argue that the analysis must be
        based on the anomaly detection error, and clarify the mechanism of the gravity-defiant learning
        curves of the nearest neighbor anomaly detectors by applying analysis based on computational
        geometry to the anomaly detection error. This talk is based on collaborative work with Kai Ming
        Ting, Jonathan R. Wells, and Sunil Aryal from Federation University, Australia.

        Takashi Washio is a full professor in Division of Information and Quantum Sciences at the
        Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research of Osaka University since 2006. He has been
        an associate professor in the same institute from 1996 to 2006. Before joining the university,
        he had been a visiting researcher of nuclear reactor laboratory of Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology (MIT) from 1988 to 1990 and a researcher in Mitsubishi Research Institute from
        1990 to 1996. His current main interest is the study on machine learning principles for high
        dimensional big data and their applications to real world problems. He has contributed many
        Japanese national projects on data mining and its applications. He has been chairs and
        program committee members in many international data mining and machine learning
        conferences including SIG-KDD, IEEE ICDM, SDM, ICML, NIPS, ECML/PKDD and PAKDD.

        <b>Title:</b> Partial Similarity Match with Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        In traditional supervised learning settings, a data object is usually represented by a single
        feature vector, called an instance. Such a formulation has achieved great success; however, its
        utility is limited when handling data objects with complex semantics where one object
        simultaneously belongs to multiple semantic categories. For example, an image showing a lion
        besides an elephant can be recognized simultaneously as an image of a lion, an elephant, "wild" or
        even "Africa"; the text document "Around the World in Eighty Days" can be classified simultaneously
        into multiple categories such as scientific novel, Jules Verne's writings or even books on
        traveling, etc. In many real tasks it is crucial to tackle such data objects, particularly when
        the labels are relevant to partial similarity match of input patterns. In this talk we will
        introduce the MIML (Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning) framework which has been shown to be
        useful for these scenarios.
