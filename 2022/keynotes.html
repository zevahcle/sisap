<b>Title:</b> Scalable High-Dimensional Similarity Search: The New Kid on the Block</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b>
There is an increasingly pressing need, by several applications in diverse domains, for developing techniques able to analyze very large collections of high-dimensional vectors.
Examples of such applications come from scientific, manufacturing and social domains, where in several cases they need to apply machine learning techniques for knowledge extraction.
It is not unusual for these applications to involve vector collections in the order of hundreds of millions to billions, which are often times not analyzed in their full detail due to their sheer size.
In this talk, we describe examples of data sources that produce high-dimensional vectors, and focus on two popular types: data series and deep network embeddings.
We discuss the solutions that have been independently developed and are used for each one of these types, and present the surprising results that emerge when we bring these solutions together.

<b>Title:</b> Smart Data Services for Sensemaking in Human-Centered Dynamic Systems</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b>
Many socio-economical critical human-centered domains (such as sustainability, public health, emergency management) are characterized by highly complex and dynamic systems, requiring data and model driven situational awareness and decision making. Successfully tackling many urgent challenges in these domains requires obtaining a deeper understanding of complex relationships and interactions among a diverse spectrum of entities in different evolving contexts.
Models have to be constructed in the presence of sensed data, along with applicable physical models, from multiple sources, often characterized by varying levels of coverage and accuracy.
Moreover, both data and models required for the said situational awareness and predictions are defined over high-dimensional and time-varying parameter spaces and require definition of similarity informed with appropriate context.
Thus, similarity driven operations  in these domains necessitate addressing several major challenges, including latent contexts of impact, heterogeneous networks of entities, dynamicity of impact in varying contexts, and high computational and I/O costs of context-sensitive impact discovery.
These algorithms and the novel data platforms they are deployed in need to be efficient and scalable in terms of off-line and on-line running times and their space requirements.
In this talk, we will provide several examples from pandemic response and disaster planning, neurology, and resilient buildings and briefly discuss outlines of possible computational approaches to these challenges.
