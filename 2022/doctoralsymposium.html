<h1>Call for Submissions - SISAP 2022 Doctoral Symposium</h1>
<p><strong>Fourth Doctoral Symposium on Similarity Search and Applications</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sisap.org/2022/doctoralsymposium.html">https://sisap.org/2022/doctoralsymposium.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Co-located with the main SISAP 2022 conference</strong></p>
<p>Bologna, Italy, Oct 5-7, 2022</p>
<h2>Call for Submissions</h2>
<p>SISAP 2022 Doctoral Symposium provides a forum for PhD students to present their research ideas and receive feedback from senior members of the research community.
The Symposium fosters a collaborative environment, encouraging constructive discussions and sharing of ideas.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions from active PhD students devoted to all issues surrounding the theory, design, analysis, practice, and application of content-based and feature-based similarity search who are in the early/mid-stage of their research and that are expecting to graduate in more than one year.
You will find a detailed list of possible topics of interest on the SISAP 2022 conference website:</p>
<p><a href="https://sisap.org/2022/callforpapers.html">https://sisap.org/2022/callforpapers.html</a></p>
<p>Submissions from students who are in the early stages of their research should provide a clear statement of the problem being addressed, and a clear outline of the planned methodology. Submissions from students who are in the mid-stage of their research should clearly state the contributions made so far, and the work lying ahead.</p>
<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Paper submission deadline: July 18, 2022 (AoE)</li>
  <li>Notification of acceptance: August 5, 2022</li>
  <li>Camera-ready submission due: August 20, 2022</li>
  <li>Conference: October 5-7, 2022</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>A submission to the doctoral symposium consists of a paper and an additional 1-page appendix (both in PDF format). 
Submissions must be single-author and written by the student alone.
The paper should be no longer than 5 pages (plus references) and should be formatted with the same rules as SISAP papers.
You will find these rules summarised on the SISAP 2022 conference website:</p>
<p><a href="https://sisap.org/2022/guidelines.html">https://sisap.org/2022/guidelines.html</a></p>
<p>The manuscripts should contain the statement of the problem being addressed, an outline of the planned methodology, contributions made so far, and the work lying ahead.
It is anticipated that the thesis work has been published elsewhere or submitted for publication, and concurrent submission of a regular paper to SISAP with technical contributions is encouraged.</p>
<p>In addition to the paper, the applicants are expected to provide a 1-page Appendix that should describe the benefits that would be obtained by attending the doctoral symposium, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A statement by the student saying why they want to attend the Doctoral Symposium.</li>
  <li>A statement by their advisor saying how the student would benefit by attending the  Doctoral Symposium.</li>
  <li>Advisors should also specifically state whether the student has written, or is close to completing, a thesis proposal (or equivalent) and when they
expect the student would defend their dissertation if they progress at a typical rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors should submit a zip file containing the paper and the appendix in PDF format through the EasyChair conference management system:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2022">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2022</a></p>
<p>SISAP 2022 Doctoral Symposium papers will be published as part of the SISAP 2022 proceedings.</p>
<h2>Review Process</h2>
<p>Submissions will be reviewed by the Doctoral Symposium Program Committee (appointed by the Doctoral Symposium Chair).
The review and decision of acceptance will balance many factors.
This includes the topic and the quality of your proposal, quality of presentation, potential for future impact of the research on the field and expected benefit to the other doctoral students attending the conference.
It also includes external factors, such as ensuring that as a group the accepted candidates exhibit a diversity of backgrounds and topics.</p>
<p>Candidates who have a clearly developed idea, who are formally considered by their institution to be working on their dissertation, and who still have time
to be influenced by participation in the PhD Doctoral Symposium will receive the strongest consideration.</p>
<h2>Further Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The author of the best Doctoral Symposium paper will receive an award during the conference banquet, along with a monetary prize given to the student directly.</li>
  <li>PhD students of the accepted Doctoral Symposium papers coming at the conference to present solely their Doctoral Symposium paper will be entitled
to a student registration fee for the entire conference.</li>
</ul>
