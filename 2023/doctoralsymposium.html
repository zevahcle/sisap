      <h1>Call for Submissions - SISAP 2023 Doctoral Symposium</h1>
      <p><strong>Fifth Doctoral Symposium on Similarity Search and Applications</strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://sisap.org/2023/doctoralsymposium.html">https://sisap.org/2023/doctoralsymposium.html</a></p>
      <p><strong>Part of the general SISAP 2023 conference</strong></p>
      <p>A Coruña, Spain, Oct 9-11, 2023</p>
      <h2>Call for Submissions</h2>
      <p>SISAP 2023 Doctoral Symposium provides a forum for PhD students to present their research ideas and receive
        feedback from senior members of the research community. The Symposium fosters a collaborative environment,
        encouraging constructive discussions and sharing of ideas.</p>
      <p>We welcome submissions from active PhD students devoted to all issues surrounding the theory, design, analysis,
        practice, and application of content-based and feature-based similarity search who are in the early/mid-stage of
        their research and that are expecting to graduate in more than one year. You will find a detailed list of
        possible topics of interest on the SISAP 2023 conference website:</p>
      <p><a href="https://sisap.org/2023/callforpapers.html">https://sisap.org/2023/callforpapers.html</a></p>
      <p>Submissions from students who are in the early stages of their research should provide a clear statement of the
        problem being addressed, and a clear outline of the planned methodology. Submissions from students who are in
        the mid-stage of their research should clearly state the contributions made so far, and the work lying ahead.
      </p>

      <h2>Important Dates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Abstract deadline: <s>June 5, 2023</s>&nbsp;<b>Extended to: June 7, 2023</b>(AoE)</li>
        <li>Paper deadline: <s>June 12, 2023</s>&nbsp;<b>Extended to: June 18, 2023</b> (AoE)</li>
        <li>Paper notification: July 24, 2023</li>
        <li>Camera-ready due: August 28, 2023</li>
        <li>Conference: October 9-11, 2023</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

      <p>A submission to the doctoral symposium consists of a paper and an additional 1-page appendix (both in PDF
        format).
        Submissions must be single-author and written by the student alone.
        The paper should be no longer than 5 pages (plus references) and should be formatted with the same rules as
        SISAP papers.
        You will find these rules summarised on the SISAP 2022 conference website:</p>
      <p><a href="https://sisap.org/2023/guidelines.html">https://sisap.org/2023/guidelines.html</a></p>
      <p>The manuscripts should contain the statement of the problem being addressed, an outline of the planned
        methodology, contributions made so far, and the work lying ahead.
        It is anticipated that the thesis work has been published elsewhere or submitted for publication, and concurrent
        submission of a regular paper to SISAP with technical contributions is encouraged.</p>
      <p>In addition to the paper, the applicants are expected to provide a 1-page Appendix that should describe the
        benefits that would be obtained by attending the doctoral symposium, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A statement by the student saying why they want to attend the Doctoral Symposium.</li>
        <li>A statement by their advisor saying how the student would benefit by attending the Doctoral Symposium.</li>
        <li>Advisors should also specifically state whether the student has written, or is close to completing, a thesis
          proposal (or equivalent) and when they
          expect the student would defend their dissertation if they progress at a typical rate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Authors should submit a zip file containing the paper and the appendix in PDF format through the EasyChair
        conference management system:</p>
      <p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2023">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2023</a>
      </p>
      <p>SISAP 2023 Doctoral Symposium papers will be published as part of the SISAP 2023 proceedings.</p>

      <h2>Review Process</h2>
      <p>Submissions will be reviewed by the Doctoral Symposium Program Committee (appointed by the Doctoral Symposium
        Chair). The review and decision of acceptance will balance many factors. This includes the topic and the quality
        of your proposal, quality of presentation, potential for future impact of the research on the field and expected
        benefit to the other doctoral students attending the conference. It also includes external factors, such as
        ensuring that as a group the accepted candidates exhibit a diversity of backgrounds and topics.
        Candidates who have a clearly developed idea, who are formally considered by their institution to be working on
        their dissertation, and who still have time to be influenced by participation in the PhD Doctoral Symposium will
        receive the strongest consideration.</p>

      <h2>Further Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The author of the best Doctoral Symposium paper will receive an award during the conference banquet, along
          with a monetary prize given to the student directly.</li>
        <li>PhD students of the accepted Doctoral Symposium papers coming at the conference to present solely their
          Doctoral Symposium paper will be entitled
          to a student registration fee for the entire conference.</li>
