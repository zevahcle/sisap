        <b>Title:</b> Keyword-Based Querying of Geo-Textual Content
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        The web is being accessed increasingly by users with a known geo-location, and increasing volumes of geo-tagged objects are available on the web, including web pages, points of interest, and microblog posts. Studies suggest that each week, several billion keyword-based queries are issued that have some form of local intent and that target geo-tagged web objects with textual descriptions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This state of affairs gives prominence to spatial web data management, and it opens to a research area with new and exciting opportunities and challenges. A prototypical spatial web query takes a user location and user-supplied keywords as arguments, and it returns objects that are spatially and textually relevant to these arguments. Due perhaps to the rich semantics of geographical space and its importance to our daily lives, many different kinds of relevant spatial web query functionality may be envisioned.
        </p>
		
		<p>
		Based on recent and ongoing work by the speaker and his colleagues, the presentation covers selected functionality and concepts relating to spatial web querying; it covers queries, including aggregate queries that return different groups of objects, in order to support different kinds of user intent; and it covers directions for the future development of keyword-based spatial web querying.

        <b>Title:</b> Towards Scalable Multimedia Analytics
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        The field of multimedia analytics has been proposed as an umbrella term for a range of techniques to explore and gain insight from multimedia collections.  Recently, we proposed to integrate data management terchniques to achieve scalable multimedia analytics, and presented a set of research questions to tackle in this field. In this talk we will present two scalability projects that address a) large-scale off-line processing of multimedia, via cluster-based computing, and b) large-scale interactive learning of image preferences, via multi-core processing and compression. We end with a discussion on the importance and challenges of scalability.
